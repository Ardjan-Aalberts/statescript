Small terminal application to insert hours and activities for the internship.

I made this small application to register my activities and hours of my internship. 
I need to make a documentation of all my hours and activities for my exams and this 
application makes that a lot easier.

To use this application, first execute config.py. This will make the files and submit 
all the necessary meta-data. After that you can execute hours.py and input.py. In hours.py 
you can manage your hours, and input.py will ask you what you are doing every thirty minutes.
